|**                 FIRST OF ALL:                  **|
|** ============================================== **|
|**    Do not use this tool on any user, server,   **|
|**    website, host, system, or any other target  **|
|**    without their consent. This is for testing  **|
|**    your own network. I am not responsible for  **|
|**    how you use this tool. This was created     **|
|**    educational purposes only.                  **|
|**    I maintain the right to change anything in  **|
|**    this document or related to the tool at any **|
|**    time, with or without prior notice.         **|
|****************************************************|
|**                 REFUND POLICY                  **|
|** ============================================== **|
|** There are no refunds. None at all. Once I have **|
|** given you access to this tool, you forfeit all **|
|** rights to any refund whatsoever, no matter how **|
|** long this tool lasts. I make no guarantees how **|
|** long this tool will last. I will keep updating **|
|** it until I grow tired or bored of it, or until **|
|** any other reason comes up that would persuade  **|
|** me to discontinue updating this. I will not    **|
|** make any guarantees on anything related to the **|
|** tool. This means uptime, shell count, power or **|
|** anything else.                                 **|

|** ============================================== **|
|**                                                **|
|** [0]You will not use this against anyone or     **|
|**    anything affiliated with this system.       **|
|**                                                **|
|** [1]You will NOT use any form of macro,         **|
|**    auto-clicker, etc. to abuse this system.    **|
|**    This is meant as a quick booter, not a      **|
|**    long term DDoSing system.                   **|
|**                                                **|
|** [2]You will not release this system to anyone  **|
|**    or anything. This system is for your eyes   **|
|**    and use only. If your friend wants a copy,  **|
|**    he or she can contact the owner and         **|
|**    purchase it. This also means you cannot     **|
|**    share your account.                         **|
|** ============================================== **|
|**  Failure to abide by the Terms of Service will **|
|**  result in your login being deactivated. If    **|
|**  your login is deactivated for any reason at   **|
|**  all, you can have it reactivated for a fee of **|
|**  $10.00 USD. If you initiate a PayPal dispute, **|
|**  I will remove your login, and you will get no **|
|**  refund, even when I win the dispute.          **|
